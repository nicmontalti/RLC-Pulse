The abstract has been translated in English below, the report is in Italian.

## Abstract
In this experiment the response of an RLC circuit to a pulse excitation was analised. Measuring the potential on the capacitator, the resonant angular frequency $\omega_0$ and the damping coefficient $$\gamma$$ were found. The expected values were $$\omega_0 = 55.4(4)$$ kHz and $$\gamma = 12.46(12)$$ kHz. An analysis in the time domained resulted in $$\omega_0 = 56.9832(7)$$ kHz and $$\gamma = 13.5017(14)$$ kHz. Apllying a Fourier transform to the signal, using an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm, the frequency response was analysed as well, resulting in $$\omega_0 = 57.0549(10)$$ kHz and $$\gamma = 13.521(2)$$ kHz.
