## Abstract
In this experiment the response of an RLC circuit to a pulse excitation was analised. Measuring the potential on the capacitator, the resonant angular frequency ω0 and the damping coefficient γ were found. The expected values were ω0 = 55.4(4) kHz and γ = 12.46(12) kHz. An analysis in the time domained resulted in ω0 = 56.9832(7) kHz and γ = 13.5017(14) kHz. Apllying a Fourier transform to the signal, using an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm, the frequency response was analysed as well, resulting in ω0 = 57.0549(10) kHz and γ = 13.521(2) kHz.
